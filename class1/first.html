	<!-- ========introduction=========== -->
	<h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2>
	<p>Nikola Tesla, often referred to as the "man who invented the 20<sup>th</sup> century," was a brilliant inventor
		and
		electrical engineer whose pioneering work laid the foundation for modern electrical power systems and wireless
		communication technologies. His inventive genius and visionary ideas continue to inspire scientists, engineers,
		and innovators worldwide.</p>


	<!-- ==========Early Life ============ -->
	<h2><u>Early Life:</u></h2>
	<p>Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in the village of Smiljan, Croatia, which was then part of the Austrian Empire.
		He was the fourth of five children in the family of Serbian Orthodox priest Milutin Tesla and his wife,
		Georgina. From a young age, Tesla displayed an extraordinary aptitude for mathematics and an insatiable
		curiosity about the natural world.</p>


	<!-- ========== Education============ -->
	<h2><u>Education:</u></h2>
	<p>After receiving his primary education in Smiljan and Gospic, Tesla attended the Polytechnic School in Graz,
		Austria, and later enrolled at the Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague. Despite facing financial
		difficulties, he excelled in his studies, particularly in mathematics and physics, and soon developed a deep
		interest in electricity and magnetism.</p>


	<!-- ========== Inventions and Discoveries============ -->
	<h2><u>Inventions and Discoveries:</u></h2>
	<p>Tesla's prolific career as an inventor spanned several decades and produced numerous groundbreaking inventions
		and discoveries. His most significant contribution was the development of alternating current (AC) electrical
		systems, which revolutionized the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. Other notable
		inventions include the Tesla coil, a high-voltage transformer that became essential in wireless transmission
		experiments, and the induction motor, which powers many household and industrial appliances to this day. Tesla
		also made significant contributions to the development of radio technology, although his work in this area was
		overshadowed by controversy surrounding patents and intellectual property rights.</p>

	<h2><code>Certainly! Here's a list of some of Nikola Tesla's notable inventions:</code></h2>

	<!-- -----list of invention------ -->
	<ul>
		<li>Alternating Current (AC) Electrical Systems: Tesla's development of AC electrical systems revolutionized the
			generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, making it practical for long-distance power
			transmission.</li><br>

		<li>Tesla Coil: The Tesla coil is a high-voltage, air-core, dual-tuned resonant transformer used in numerous
			applications, including radio frequency oscillators, wireless transmission experiments, and electrical
